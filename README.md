## Privacy Policy
neuro centre (eragon11) operates as an Amazon Alexa Skill and as a Facebook App created by Florian Dreschner. It is eragon11’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating.

We use your Personal Information only to provide a personalized user experience. By enabling the skill, you agree to use of information in accordance with this policy.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain users to eragon11’s skill choose to interact with eragon in ways that require eragon to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that eragon gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we use the provided access token to fetch information about the birthday of an user from Facebook. eragon collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the users's interaction with eragon. eragon does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And users can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information by not disabling the skill.

**Information We Collect from Other Sources**

With your authorization, we also obtain information about you from other sources. When you link your account to Facebook, we will receive information from that service (such as your birthday) via an API call to that service.

**Data Retention Policy**

We will not retain any user provided data.

**Log Data**

To be able to investigate issues with the skill, eragon stores logs with Amazon CloudWatch. These logs may included personally-identifying information as well, which are not exposed, sold or used besides the tracking of issues.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

eragon discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on eragon’s behalf, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees may be located outside of your home country; by using eragon’s skill, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. eragon will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, as described above, eragon discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when eragon believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of eragon, third parties or the public at large. eragon takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

**Privacy Policy Changes**

Although most changes are likely to be minor, eragon may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in eragon’s sole discretion. eragon encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this skill after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
